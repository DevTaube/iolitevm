# The Iolite virtual machine

The Iolite virtual machine is a register-based virtual machine with a garbage collector that uses a mix of reference counting and tracing to ensure that GC runs don't stop execution of any other threads.  

The Iolite programming language has been abandoned. However, this part of the langage is complete.
